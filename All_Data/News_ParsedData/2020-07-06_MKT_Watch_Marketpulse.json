The move comes a day after Tesla stock closed at a fresh record of $1,133.36, boosting its valuation to more than $207 billion and above,   at least for now, Japan's Toyota Motor Corp.'s TM, -1.18% $203 billion market value. Toyota, which makes more than 8 million vehicles a year, long has been the No. 1 global car maker by market capitalization. Tesla is expected to report second-quarter sales this week, with analysts polled by FactSet expecting the sale of 72,000 vehicles in the quarter, of which 61,000 are Model 3s. \"While the stock has been roaring higher, we believe the main fundamental catalyst continues to be the massive China market which is showing clear signs of a spike in demand for Musk & Co. heading into the rest of this year,\" Ives wrote. The analyst is expecting Tesla to reporter stronger second-quarter deliveries than the market is expecting, and could hit 450,000 for the year. Tesla shares jumped another 6.5% premarket to bring its year-to-date gain to 168%, while the S&P 500  has fallen 3.6%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
